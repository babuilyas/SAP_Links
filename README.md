# SAP_Links
SAP Link is a project started to fix broken SAP links to documentation, SCN posts and others.

The project will provide browser extensions to help user find alternate links for the broken links.

This is my first browser extension initiative fairly due to broken links! I appreciate the community to complement the project with their expertise in the browser extension development for major browsers.

Good bye.
